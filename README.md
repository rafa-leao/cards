# Flash Cards

CLI made with the Go standard library to practice flash cards.

Inspired by the Quiz App in [gophercises](https://gophercises.com/) and the idea from this repo of [app ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/FlashCards-App.md)

## How do I use it?

**Be sure you have Go properly installed.**

1. Copy the repo in %GOPATH/src:

    - ```git clone https://github.com/rafa-leao/goCards```

2. Go in the repo, open your terminal:

    - ``` go install ``` 
    
 3. Type commands:
    - The commands schema: ``` goCards --flag value ```
 
    - For the command list: ``` goCards --h --help ```    
    
*If ``` %GOPATH/bin/ ``` is in your path you should be able to use those commands anywhere in your terminal*
